# XDA Google Summer of Code
This is the XDA repo for [Google's Summer of Code](http://code.google.com/soc/). We are looking to become a mentoring organization for 2017 and are in the process of gathering ideas for students to submit proposals on.

## What is Google Summer of Code?
For quite some time now Google has provided students with the opportunity to spend their summer break/holiday writing code and learning about open source development, while also earning a wage. Think of it as a paid internship! Students who are accepted into the program will work with a mentor alongside an open source community (XDA in this case). The student application deadline for 2017 is 20 March 2017.  
The program is open to students age 18 and older who have finished secondary school. To find out more about the program, visit the [GSoC site](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/).
