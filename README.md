# XDA Google Summer of Code
This is the XDA repo for [Google's Summer of Code](http://code.google.com/soc/). We are looking to become a mentoring organization for 2017 and are in the process of gathering ideas for students to submit proposals on.

## What is Google Summer of Code?
For quite some time now Google has provided students with the opportunity to spend their summer break/holiday writing code and learning about open source development, while also earning a wage. Think of it as a paid internship! Students who are accepted into the program will work with a mentor alongside an open source community (XDA in this case). The student application deadline for 2017 is 20 March 2017.  
The program is open to students age 18 and older who have finished secondary school. To find out more about the program, visit the [GSoC site](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/) or their nicely-formed [FAQ](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/faq).

## The Process
### Project Ideas
Anyone can submit an idea, but it does need to follow the following structure:
```
a) a project title/description  
b) more detailed description of the project (2-5 sentences) 
c) expected outcomes  
d) skills required/preferred  
e) possible mentors at XDA (can be the idea submittor but not a student)
f) if possible, an easy, medium or hard rating for the project
```
To submit an idea, do so by 

### Student looking for an idea
As a student you will need to submit a [project proposal](http://write.flossmanuals.net/gsocstudentguide/writing-a-proposal/) that you want to work on for the summer. If accepted, students spend a month integrating with their organizations prior to the start of coding. Students then have three months to code, meeting the deadlines agreed upon with their mentors. A helpful link for students is the [GSoC Student Manual](http://write.flossmanuals.net/gsocstudentguide/what-is-google-summer-of-code/).

### Mentors
Existing contributors within XDA can choose to mentor a student project. Mentors and students work together to determine appropriate milestones and requirements for the summer. Mentor interaction is a vital part of the program. If you're interested in being a mentor, please visit the [Mentors Wiki page](https://github.com/xda/summer-of-code/wiki/Mentors) and add yourself.
